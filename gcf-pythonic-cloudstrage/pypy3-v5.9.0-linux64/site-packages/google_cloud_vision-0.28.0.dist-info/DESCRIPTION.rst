Authentication
--------------

With ``google-cloud-python`` we try to make authentication as painless as
possible. Check out the `Authentication section`_ in our documentation to
learn more. You may also find the `authentication document`_ shared by all
the ``google-cloud-*`` libraries to be helpful.

Using the API
-------------

The Google Cloud `Vision`_ (`Vision API docs`_) API enables developers to
understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine
learning models in an easy to use REST API. It quickly classifies images
into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"),
detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads
printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your
image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing
scenarios through image sentiment analysis. Analyze images uploaded
in the request or integrate with your image storage on Google Cloud
Storage.

See the ``google-cloud-python`` API `Documentation`_ to learn
how to analyze images using this library.
