Authentication
--------------

With ``google-cloud-python`` we try to make authentication as painless as
possible. Check out the `Authentication section`_ in our documentation to
learn more. You may also find the `authentication document`_ shared by all
the ``google-cloud-*`` libraries to be helpful.

Using the API
-------------

`Cloud Firestore`_ (`Firestore API docs`_) is a flexible, scalable
database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google
Cloud Platform. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in
sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support
for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of
network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless
integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform products,
including Cloud Functions.

interact with the Cloud Firestore using this Client Library.

.. code:: python

    from google.cloud import firestore

    # Add a new document
    db = firestore.Client()
    doc_ref = db.collection(u'users').document(u'alovelace')
    doc_ref.set({
        u'first': u'Ada',
        u'last': u'Lovelace',
        u'born': 1815
    })

    # Then query for documents
    users_ref = db.collection(u'users')
    docs = users_ref.get()

    for doc in docs:
        print(u'{} => {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))
